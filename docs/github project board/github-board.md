# Github project Boards

Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. <br/>
You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps,<br/>
or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create <br/>
customized workflows that suit your needs.<br/>

**Note**: Projects (beta), the all-new projects experience, is now available. <br/>
For more information about projects (beta), see [About projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) <br/>

**Project boards** are made up of issues, pull requests, and notes that are categorized as<br/>
cards in columns of your choosing. You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to<br/> 
reorder cards within a column, move cards from column to column, and change the <br/>
order of columns. <br/>

**Project board cards** contain relevant metadata for issues and pull requests, like labels,<br/>
assignees, the status, and who opened it. You can view and make lightweight edits to issues <br/>
and pull requests within your project board by clicking on the issue or pull request's title.<br/>
